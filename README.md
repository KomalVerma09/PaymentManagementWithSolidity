# 🎓 Student Payment Management System 

Welcome to the **Student Payment Management System**! This project showcases a decentralized application (DApp) for managing student records using a Solidity smart contract and a Web3-powered front-end.  

---

## 🚀 About the Project  

This DApp allows users to fetch student details securely by entering their **School ID** and **Roll Number** in specific formats. It's an easy-to-use, decentralized system built for transparency and efficiency.

> You can't see the **Add School** container because it is only visible to the contract owner. Only the owner can add schools.
